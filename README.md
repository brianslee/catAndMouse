2. Running the Game:

Type ‘./catAndMouse’ to run the game. 

At this point the terminal will pop up another screen, switching focus to this new screen. 

Return to the terminal again and enter the IP4 address (ex: 172.16.254.1). 

Then enter ‘m’ or ‘a’ for the appropriate characters: ‘m’ for Marine and ‘a’ for Alien.
